    "### 1.What is Kaggle?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle, a subsidiary of Google LLC, is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why Kaggle?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Good resource for the realistic data and pratice the economic sense and data&modeling skills\n",
    "- Good hackathon for the data scientists for the bounty hunting (Some of giving you million USD )\n",
    "- Good template to use for your research projects\n",
    "- You can also use it and pratice on cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Collect Data Information\n",
    "\n",
    "- go to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets\n",
    "- Browse the datasets by using keywords or random walk\n",
    "- Select one dataset, which are large enough, related to economics or finance, interesting\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a research topics from your dataset and put it on a ipynb report\n",
    "- Data Analysis about your dataset on the report \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Linear Modeling by Using statsmodels\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose your target and features\n",
    "- Write the math regression function in LaTex on your report \n",
    "- Use [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) to do the linear regression and put the regression results on your ipynb report\n",
